# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, **please do not create a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by emailing: [m.karimvand.84@gmail.com].

We will respond as soon as possible and keep you informed about the progress.

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
